<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Welcome to <strong>TDM</strong>!  This game extends Microsoft’s all-time classic Minesweeper into a third dimension, challenging not only your deductive reasoning abilities but your visual & spatial skills as well.  If you’re familiar with old Minesweeper, you should find <strong>TDM</strong> really easy to figure out.  It works essentially the same way.</p>

<p>Instead of a playing field full of squares, you get a playing cube full of blocks.  The objective of the game is to open all the blocks without triggering a mine.  If you open a block with a mine, however, the mine explodes and you lose.  To aid in figuring out which blocks have mines and thus which ones to avoid, most blocks you open will contain a number indicating how many bombs are adjacent to that block.  For instance, an open block with three mines next to it would have the number 3 clearly visible in it.  These numbers become visible once you open the block.  (Any block which isn’t adjacent to any mines will be simply blank.)</p>

<p>Using deductive reasoning and a bit of visualization, you can figure out which squares contain bombs and which do not.  Though simple in principle, this can become very complex, especially as the volume of the cube and the number of bombs increases.</p>

<p>The rest of this help file will give specific playing instructions and expand on some additional options available to you as a player.  Enjoy!</p>

<h3>The Startup Screen</h3>

<h3>Basic Gameplay</h3>

<p>If you've loaded the right resolution for your monitor (see <a href=#start>above</a>), the menu should come up after a few moments.  (Your monitor will make some odd "clicking" sounds first if you selected full-screen mode.)  The menu has four options: Easy, Normal, Insane, and Exit.  Exit will leave the game; the other three options will let you play varying levels of difficulty.  Simply move your mouse to the option you wish to select and click your left mouse button.</p>

<p>If you start a new game by clicking on either Easy, Normal, or Insane, the menu will disappear and a cube of the appropriate size will appear:
<ul>
<li>Easy is a 3x3x3 cube (27 blocks) with 7 mines.
<li>Normal is a 5x5x5 cube (125 blocks) with 31 mines.
<li>Insane is a 10x10x10 cube (1000 blocks) with 250 mines!
</ul>
Across the top in red text you will see the number of mines left to mark and the elapsed time since the game started.  That clock will keep zooming on relentlessly until you either set off a mine or you clear all the non-mine blocks.</p>

<p>You maneuver the cube by pressing the keyboard's arrow keys.  When you feel adventurous, move your mouse to a block on the cube and left-click; this will open up that block.  If the block has no mines, it will clear.  If the newly-cleared block is next to any blocks with mines, it will display the number of mines it's next to.  (For example, if it's next to two mines, it'll display the numeral '2'.)  If the newly-cleared block is <em>not</em> next to any mines, it will clear all the adjacent blocks for you.</p>

<p>(The definition of "adjacent" used in <strong>TDM</strong> doesn't quite match that of Microsoft's Minesweeper, however.  For two blocks to be adjacent, their faces must touch.  This means that next to a '1', the mine is either straight up or down, left or right, or "in" or "out."  <strong>TDM</strong> doesn't count diagonal blocks as adjacent.)</p>

<p>If the cleared block is a mine, however, it will explode.  All the mines in the puzzle will appear, letting you move the cube around and see the structure of the game.  At that point, of course, the game is over and you have lost.</p>

<p>At any point you can hit the escape key to display the menu again.  Be warned, though:  Once you do that, you cannot return to your game in progress.  The menu will respond just as described earlier.</p>

<p>Your goal is to clear all the blocks which don't contain mines.  Good hunting!</p>

<h3>Additional Features</h3>

<p>To help you along, you can <em>flag</em> blocks you feel pretty sure are mines.  Just move the mouse over the block you suspect and right-click.  The appearance of the block will change, and then you can't accidentally click on that square and detonate the bomb you already knew about.  You can change your mind later by just pointing at the mine you flagged and right-clicking again.</p>

<p>If you wish to take a larger gamble, you can <em>defuse</em> a bomb you have flagged.  To do this, simply hold down the control (Ctrl) key and point and left-click on the flagged block you wish to defuse.  If it really is a bomb, that block will vanish and the surrounding numbers will adjust to match the new mine situation.  If you try to defuse something that is <em>not</em> a bomb, however, you will blow up the puzzle!  This option can be really helpful when marked mines get in the way of the puzzle.</p>

<p><strong>TDM</strong> has two hotkey combinations.  First, if you simply wish to start a new game at the same level of difficulty, you can press the F2 key instead of going through the menu.  Second, if you need to exit the game <em>really</em> quickly, just press the Alt+F4 keys at the same time and release them.  (That's the "boss" hotkey.)</p>

<h3>About <strong>TDM</strong></h3>

<p><strong>TDM</strong> emerged from the minds of four computer science undergraduates at <a href="http://www.stmartin.edu/">Saint Martin's College</a> in the 2002-2003 academic year.  The four obsessive programmers are:
<ul>
<li>Zac Vawter
<li>Hedim Ramirez
<li>Michael Smith
<li>Mitchell Hokoana
</ul>
Zac gets credit as the head programmer/designer and for doing far, far more than his share of the coding.  Hedim gave the project good, consistent support and wrote most of the code Zac didn't.  Mike generated the majority of paperwork required, helped with the math and tweaked details of the game as needed.  Mitch provided <strong>TDM</strong>'s theme.</p>
